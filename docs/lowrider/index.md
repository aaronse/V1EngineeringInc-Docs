# Low Rider CNC v4

The LowRider CNC v4 is the V1 Engineering version of a CNC router that can handle up to full sheet material. If the MPCNC is not big enough for you, this picks up where that left off. 

![!LR4 Fancy Picture](../img/lr4/lr4_neon.jpg){: width="600"}

The Beta team put in months of effort helping to refine and improve all aspects of this design. Countless prints were made only to be scrutinized, revised, and remade. Debates were had, caps lock was used, it was not easy for any of us, but it was very fun. I am sure I can speak for the whole team, we are proud of what we accomplished, and I am confident it will outperform your expectations.

### Key Points

 * Foams, wood, and plastic are no problem, aluminum and brass are no problem for an experienced user.

 * Most parts can be 3D printed. To save from shipping or printing large parts, the machine can be partially assembled to cut them itself.

 * Easily Removable from the table for storage.

 * Inexpensive hardware store conduit is the recommended rail. Rails ranging from 29.5mm to 32mm will work.

 * Many tool options, in terms of functionality and brands. Blank DIY mount files are available.

 * Full Y axis squaring, Z axis leveling, and Z probing are standard for excellent precision and accuracy.

 * Works with any 5 driver board.

 * Can be used with almost any firmware Marlin, RepRap firmware, GRBL, FluidNC, or others.

 * The average total build cost is easily under $800!!

### Geometry

 * A Typical full sized Build has a working volume of 2440mmx1220mmx100mm (8x4'x4"), of course the smaller you can build it the faster it will be.

 * This CNC router can handle any length (within reason), the Y direction is only bound by your table length (or your shop floor).

 * The single Y rail keeps the machine properly constrained while maintaining ease of use. Two rails are extremely difficult to align, and fully constrained rails do not allow for easy removal of the machine.

 * Width (X axis or "Beam") should always be the shorter axis.

 * The Z direction (height) is 100mm (4") of travel. A standard build would give you 50mm of Z cutting depth, or you can use a drop table to use all 100mm. 

 * This router is most rigid when working near the table surface, opposite of most conventional gantry CNC machines. So the lower the axis, the more rigid the machine.

### Tool Options

This is a CNC platform, so just about any tool can easily be mounted to the LowRider CNC. The most typical is a router or spindle, Diode laser, pen or even a drag knife. The [Makita 700](https://amzn.to/3NgdqGg) series is available worldwide and highly recommended.

## Parts Needed

### Rails

You are looking for either 29.5mm, 30mm, or 32mm Outside Dimension steel tubes. In the U.S. and parts of Canada this will be 1" OD EMT Conduit, off the shelf hardware store conduit (not rigid conduit). In other countries if you use metal conduit it same thing but you will either be 30mm or 32mm OD.

 * You want the right OD +-0.2mm.
 * At least 1.3mm thick wall.
 * Steel, Stainless Steel, DOM Steel (aluminum and carbon fiber will not work)

 If your country does not use metal conduit things to look for are metal supply companies, closet rods, or boat suppliers tend to have stainless tubes.

 Super thick walls, solid rods, and filled tubes will gain little to no rigidity and just add mass.


### Printed Parts

Rather not spend the time printing all the parts, you can buy a set here, [V1 Shop](https://www.v1e.com/collections/lowrider-parts/products/....TED){:target="_blank"}.

Or print your own. No supports needed, keep the default orientation. PLA is recommended for ultimate rigidity, other 
filaments With great rigidity and added heat resistance are PET-GF/CF and PC-GF/CF.  You will need about 2.7kg of filament for a full set with tool mount and a board box.

3 walls rectilinear or cubic infill for most parts. Thicker layers, since these are large parts, no more than 80% nozzle diameter to layer thickness ratio to keep steep walls working.


!!! info 

    Printer Skew calibration is highly recommended, [Vector3D](https://vector3d.shop/products/calilantern-calibration){:target="balnk"}, makes a wonderful tool. Skew calibration is enough size calibration should not be needed.

 * "###" = various Sizes

 * Brace note- Print Brace_Max_### and one Brace_### at 60% infill. These will be the end braces and benefit from added rigidity.

 * If a part name if followed by a verion number use the highest one. V1, V2, V3... Means there was a fix or edit.

!!! warning
    Cura based slicers seem to work a little different. Make sure the parts are aligned on your bed as they appear in the Printables thumbnails. Bridging also seems to be a bit of an issue for some of the internal overhangs. It is best to check the "Dust Skirt" and "YZ_Plate" internal features after slicing to be certain the bridges are bridging the short way, not the long way.
    Repetier\PrusaSlicer based slicers have been tested to work as expected.


## Flat Parts

#### Strut Plates

You can assemble the machine using the printed temp strut plates and then use the machine to cut its own strut plates. You will need a rigid material 6.35mm (1/4") or thinner. MDF or hardboard is a great easy to find option, plastics or metals are a premium option. Jamie, Vector76, made this easy to use site so you can have any size plates you can dream of. His site has all sorts of other helpful things linked on other Docs pages.

[Vector76 Strut Generator](https://vector76.github.io/Web_OpenSCAD_Customizer/strut_plate.html){:target="_blank"}.

The strut length comes from the calculator, but it will cut slightly smaller (0.5mm) by design.The Wings are refering to the parts that make the plate nearly touch the rails to fill in the gaps.

![!LR4 strut plate Picture](../img/lr4/strut.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}


#### XZ Plates

The Metal XZ plates can be purchased in the [V1E.com shop](https://www.v1e.com/products/lowrider-4-aluminium-xz-plates), or you can find the DXF to cut your own with the printed parts files linked above. Aluminum or steel 1/4" (6.35mm) thick material is suggested to work well with the hardware as is. If you want to use thicker or thinner material you will need to adjust the 16 M3x10mm screws to compensate. There is currently no printed option this time.

### Table

Your table needs only be as fancy as a sheet of wood on a relatively flat, smooth surface. A CNC can self correct many of its own imperfections if needed. Typically, our tables only support the CNC and some material, so nothing heavy duty is required.

Any existing table that is large enough is fine. You can use its surface directly, or a more popular option is to add a waste board of some sort that is replaceable as it gets used and cut into.

Next option would be to build a basic table with any material that is easy to source for you. Accuracy is not super important, but the more square and flat you make it, the better.

If you have a table saw, circular saw with a guide, or a CNC machine, a Torsion Box table is pretty easy to make and can lead to a very stable surface that will last a long time. Here is a basic parametric set of plans that are easily configurable [V1 LR Table](https://forum.v1e.com/t/parametric-table/37698){:target="_blank"}.

## Assembly

### YZ Plate Assemblies

Start the assembly with the YZ plate. 

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/fullYZplate.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * This is what the finished assembly will look like.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/label.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Start by doing yourself a favor by labeling all the wires before you run them.
 * As small and as tight to the wire as you can get makes things the easiest.
 * Label the wires and not the pugs so they still fit in the control board and you can read them without unplugging.
 * Typically, as you face the machine, the left side is Y0 and Z0, and the right side is Y1 and Z1.


![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yze1.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Use the M2.5 screws to secure the crimped or soldered endstop to the Z_Stop_Min/Max part

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yze2.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"} 

 * Notice what way the lever faces, away from the flat side.
 * Sorry for the blurry image, I need to take a new one.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yze3.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"} 

 * Run the wire through the channel


![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yze4.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"} 

 * Lightly secure the Z stop part with an M5 Screw and nut.
 * The nut gets pressed in from the YZ plate face.
 * Start with the assembly in the low position, this will get adjusted later.
 
![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yze5.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"} 

 * Run the endstop wire all the way out the bottom of the YZ plate.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yze6.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}  

 * Insert both M5 idler nuts into place

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yze7.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}  

 * Add the M5 Screws to hold the nuts into place until later.


![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzs1.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"} 

 * Use the alignment gauge on the top of the YZ plate to align the pulley.
 * Secure the pulley with the set/grub screw on the flat face first, then the other screw.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzs2.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Notice the labeled wire
 * Feed the wire through the channel

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzs3.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Use two M3 screws to hold the stepper in place lightly, the other two screws come later.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzw1.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Build the front wheel, both are similar. The heads face outside the machine or down.
 * Snug up the large bolts do not crush the part.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzw2.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Two M3 screws will secure the front wheel and the rest of the Y stepper.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzw3.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Snug up all 4 stepper screws.
 * If there is any play, make sure the outer faces are flush with each other. You can lay the parts on a flat table with the wheels hanging off the edge to align them before snugging it up.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzb1.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Load your Y axis belt
 * Cut it to length according to the calculator
 * You can remove the M5 screws to make this easier
 * Add the idlers and M5 screws back into place.
 * Seat the screws, but do not crush the plastic or the idler bearings.
 * A drop of light oil or lube on these bearings can help to extend the life of them.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yze8.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Wire labeled


![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yze9.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

* Run the wires through the first channel.
* Use the M2.5 screws to secure the endstop with the arm facing out.

!!! warning

    From this point on, be cautious not to snag the little lever on anything.
    You can hang the wheels and lever off the edge of the table if needed.




![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzw4.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Run the small wires through the wire keeper first
 * Then run the stepper wire to hold them all in.
 * If you are having a hard time do not pry the tab, simply push the wires in with your pulley allen key or a flat head screwdriver.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzw5.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * All the wires should be to the back of the plate.
 * Feed them one at a time out of the slot in the slot in the back.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzw6.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"} 
 
 * When you get all the wires through, it is best to bundle them.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzz1.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Use the guide on the top of the YZ plate to align the coupler.
 * Tighten the set/grub screw on the flat first, the other.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzz2.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"} 

 * Run the wire out the back channel.
 * You might need to jiggle the other wires to let it feed through.
 * Bundle for safety.
 * M3 screws to secure the stepper, start all 4 first, then final snug.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzz3.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Use the sharp edge of the Linear rail to chisel the rail bed smooth.
 * This simple step makes both rails work easier.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzz4.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Loosely add all the M3 screws to the linear rails, get the heads just under the rail surface.
 * Keep an eye out for off center M3 screw heads, they can be sneaky and make this next step harder. 

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzz5.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Notice the Y endstop hanging off the table as to not bother the small lever.
 * Add XZ plate using M3 screws. Snug.
 * XZ max has the large hole, Shown.
 * XZ Min has the slot at the top.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzz6.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Snug all the rail screws 
 * Move the XZ plate the full range of motion for each screw to assure there is no binding and everything stays smooth.
 * Add the T8 Leadscrew to the coupler. Make sure the leadscrew is fully seated and touching the stepper shaft.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzz7.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Add the brass nut to the Z_Nut
 * 1-2 M3 screws is all that is needed.
 * This could be a snug fit, use pliers to press fit if needed. 
 * Thread this on to the leadscrew brass face down

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzs4.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * The Z stubs get 2 hidden nuts and are secured to the XZ plates with M5 screws.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzs5.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * The hidden M5 nuts get pressed in and fully seated.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzs6.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * If you have trouble seating the nuts, you can;
 * Press them in with a flat head as shown here
 * Or you can thread the M5 through the XZ plate and use it to pull them into place.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzs7.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Snug in the Z stubs using the two M5 screws.
 * Leave out the cross tensioner screws for now.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzw7.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Assemble the back wheel.
 * Bolt heads facing out or down.
 * Snug up the bolts.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzw8.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * Insert the "hidden" M5 Nut
 * Snug up the wheel assembly with the M5
 * If there is any play make sure the outer faces are flush.
 * Sloppy wheel alignment can lead to the whole beam not being very square to the table.

![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/yzw9.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"} 

 * Take the time to set your Z endstops.
 * You want them to trigger before the bearing blocks hit the top stop block
 
![!LR4 yz assm](../img/lr4/fullYZplate.jpg){: loading=lazy width="600"}

 * How did you do, wanna yell at me or did you have fun?
 * Now is a great time to take a photo and share it on some social media.
 * You are building a robot that will hold a power tool, everyone needs to hear about that.

#### Initial Squaring

To square the machine, it is easiest to mark 4 points and measure the diagonal. This is how we set the Y axis homing to square the machine relative to the rail. You will probably need to repeat this a couple of times to get it under 1mm difference. This is a multiplied error, so 1mm or less is very very good.

You can cable tie a pen to the vacuum mount Or even easier is use a [V-Bit](https://www.v1e.com/products/1-8-45-degree-v-bit) in your router to pop a tiny hole into some tape.

You can also automate this process with Jamie's ["Squareness Marks"](https://vector76.github.io/gcode_tpgen/){:target="_blank"} test. 
 * Home the X and Y axis.
 * Start with G92 X0 Y0 Z0 - Check this box and where the tip is will be 0,0,0. I suggest starting the tip just above the paper.
 * Z level for tip-down - Make this number more negative if you find some of your marks are not hitting the paper, but you want as light a touch as possible.
 * Z level for tip-up - You can go as high as you need to not drag the pen tip.
 * Feedrate - This is set at a safe travel rate. The Default is safe.
 * Extents - This is where you set the dimensions of your table. The further apart the marks, the more accurate your table will be.

![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (81).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

 * I use tape, so I can be sure I am using the correct mark.
 * Home the X and Y axis. This step is important.
 * Use the Z axis to mark a small dot at 0,0.

![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (82).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

 * Now drive the machine to your X axis furthest point (or very close to it).
 * Use the Z to mark the dot.

![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (83).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

 * Drive to the Y extreme and repeat the process for the back two corners.

![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (84).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

 * Now measure the diagonals to the best of your ability. Note the longer one, and subtract to find the difference. Under 1mm is very good.

JackPot CNC Controller - In the WebUI you can add to your Y axis pull-off distance to correct any skew. Scroll all teh way down and hit save. Back on the main screen use the "Save" macro to make the changes stick after a re-boot.

SKR Pro / Marlin - If you are over 1mm in difference you can use the terminal on your SKR Pro or a USB 
connection and repetier host to add a homing offset. "M666 Y0.5" will move your Y1 
stepper 0.5mm away from the stop block after it homes. "M666 Y-0.5" will move your 
Y2 stepper away instead. You want to move the longer dimension side away from the 
block. A good first guess is the difference in your measurements (or you can use a 
trig calculator and add a bit because your end stops are further away than the 
dots). Now Use "M500" to save it to the EEPROM. Re-home X and Y and test it again.

#### Z Leveling

![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (85).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

 * Z leveling is a bit easier than the Y axis if you have a touch plate. You can also use any sort of block or piece of paper as a feeler gauge. 
 * We are only looking for the difference here.

![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (86).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

 Steps
 
 1. Home all three of your axis.

 2. Get Readings
    * Touch plate  
     * If you are using the touch plate, You can use the probe tab for the Jackpot CNC controller or for the SKR Pro / Marlin- you probe by using G38.2 Z0 in the terminal window.
     * When it gets there, take note of the current Z position (top of the Jackpot screen or terminal-M114). Then move it up and over to your X axis extreme and probe again, taking note of the Z axis position. Take the difference and adjust the side that moved furthest.
     * The way I have started to do this is Home and probe twice on each side. So G28 Z0, G38.2 Z0, M114, G28 Z0, G38.2 Z0, M114, Then move over G0 X1250, G28 Z0, G38.2 Z0, M114, G28 Z0, G38.2 Z0, M114. From there subtract the average of both sides, M666 Z0.5, M500. Then test again. G28 Z0, G38.2 Z0, M114, G28 Z0, G38.2 Z0, M114, Then move over G0 X1250, G28 Z0, G38.2 Z0, M114, G28 Z0, G38.2 Z0, M114.

   * Feeler Gauge
     * You will drive your Z axis down until you just make contact with the touch plate and take note of the current Z axis position. Repeat this for the other end of the X axis. Take the difference and adjust the side that moved furthest.

![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (87).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

 3. Make adjustments

   * Jackpot CNC Controller / FluidNC
     * Adjust the Z pulloff in the settings tab.
     * Save at the bottom of the screen
     * Save macro on the home screen.

   * SKR Pro / Marlin
     * You adjust by running "M666 Z0.5" the number is in millimeters. These numbers are counting down from 200, so 120 is further away than 130. Start by adjusting 0.2mm more than your difference.
     * Save with M500 after each adjustment
     * Home all three axis and check your work (go back to Step #2).

#### Making the Strut plates


!!! warning 
   NEED INFO

At this point you should be ready to make some cuts. To be certain it all goes as planned, you can 
make a test cut in high density foam, or simply make an air cut. To make an air cut you, just home 
your machine above the table and run the gcode. This lets you watch that it moves as you would 
expect it to and doesn't snag or have any faults in the code.

[Basic software setup](../software/estlcam-basics.md){:target="_blank"}

[Basic CAM settings](../tools/milling-basics.md){:target="_blank"}

TED-----Gcode making - TODO

The two strut plates should be 6.35mm (1/4") or thinner MDF or similarly rigid material. Plastic or metal are fine.
You will want to cut each plate as close to the side of your build as you can to assure your build has the rigidity to do so. Meaning in the center of your table is NOT the best place to make cuts before you have strut plates.

![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (88).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

 * Getting ready to make your first cuts all starts with loading the material.

 * Make sure the edge is behind your Endmill in the Y direction and parallel with the edge in the X direction. 
 
![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (89).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

 * Checking the front and back edges relative to the table. (To the rail would be a more proper measurement)

![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (90).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

 * Secure the material and make sure your means will not interfere with the core as it passes over. I use screws with large heads.

![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (91).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

 * This is what a finished cut looks like. All parts are held in place with small tabs of material that can be cut with a saw or utility knife.

#### Final Assembly

![!LR3 Fancy Picture](../img/lr3/LR3 (98).jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Measure the heel and toe distances across your machine, make sure they are equal. If not adjust the end clamps. Problems can arrise if your rails are too long after you install the strut plates.
